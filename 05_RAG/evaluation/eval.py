FILE: eval.py
PURPOSE: The RAG Evaluation Execution Engine

This is the core script that grades both the Retriever (Vector DB/Embeddings) and
the Generator (the LLM). It runs the test questions through the actual RAG pipeline
and calculates mathematical performance metrics.

DEPENDENCIES:
- litellm: A universal router that allows the script to call any LLM (local or cloud) using standard syntax.
- pydantic: Enforces strict data typing for the evaluation outputs.

--- CLASSES ---
1. RetrievalEval (Pydantic BaseModel):
   Defines the data structure for the retrieval grades. It forces the output to strictly
   contain floats and ints for MRR, NDCG, and keyword coverage.

2. AnswerEval (Pydantic BaseModel):
   Defines the structured JSON output required from the LLM-as-a-judge. It forces the
   evaluator LLM to provide a text 'feedback' string alongside numerical scores (1-5)
   for accuracy, completeness, and relevance.

--- RETRIEVAL MATH FUNCTIONS ---
3. calculate_mrr(keyword, retrieved_docs):
   Calculates the Mean Reciprocal Rank for a single keyword. It scans the retrieved chunks
   from top to bottom. If it finds the keyword at rank 1, it scores 1.0. If at rank 3,
   it scores 0.33. If missing, it scores 0.0.

4. calculate_dcg(relevances, k):
   A mathematical helper function that calculates Discounted Cumulative Gain. It adds up
   the relevance scores of the chunks but applies a logarithmic penalty to chunks that
   appear lower in the ranking list.

5. calculate_ndcg(keyword, retrieved_docs, k):
   Calculates Normalized DCG. It figures out the actual DCG based on where the keywords
   appeared, calculates the "Ideal DCG" (what the score would be if the keywords were
   perfectly at the very top), and divides the two to get a final score between 0.0 and 1.0.

--- EVALUATION EXECUTION FUNCTIONS ---
6. evaluate_retrieval(test, k):
   Takes a single TestQuestion object. It calls the actual RAG database (`fetch_context`),
   passes the retrieved chunks into the math functions above, averages the scores across
   all the required keywords, and returns a compiled `RetrievalEval` object.

7. evaluate_answer(test):
   The LLM-as-a-Judge function. It calls the full RAG pipeline (`answer_question`) to get
   a generated answer. It then builds a strict system prompt instructing an evaluator LLM
   (defined by the `MODEL` variable) to compare the generated answer against the
   `reference_answer`. It uses LiteLLM's `response_format` parameter to force the evaluator
   model to return its grades specifically matching the `AnswerEval` Pydantic schema.

--- RUNNERS & CLI ---
8. evaluate_all_retrieval():
   A generator function that iterates through every line in `tests.jsonl` and runs the
   retriever evaluation, yielding real-time progress.

9. evaluate_all_answers():
   A generator function that iterates through every test question and runs the full
   LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation pipeline.

10. run_cli_evaluation(test_number):
    A debugging helper. Allows you to test a single specific question from the dataset
    by its row index, printing a cleanly formatted report to the terminal.

11. main():
    The entry point of the script when run from the command line. It parses the row number
    argument and triggers `run_cli_evaluation`.
